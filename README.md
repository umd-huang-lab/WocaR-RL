Efficient Adversarial Training without Attacking: Worst-Case-Aware Robust Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a reference implementation for Worst-Case-Aware Robust Reinforcement Learning (WocaR-RL).

Our implementation for WocaR-PPO is mainly based on [ATLA](https://github.com/huanzhang12/ATLA_robust_RL).
